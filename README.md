# EV Charging Site Dashboard

A responsive React Native dashboard for managing EV charging sites with ROI analysis, cost analytics, charger performance metrics, and action steps.

## Current Status

âœ… **Working State Achieved** - App loads with dynamic responsive system  
âœ… **Navigation** - Switches between tabs (mobile) and drawer (tablet/desktop)  
âœ… **Responsive Layout** - Space-aware quadrant system with proper sizing across all breakpoints  
âœ… **Enhanced ROI Visualization** - Smart chart windowing with proper month labels and data visibility  
âœ… **Layout Structure** - Fixed overlap issues and implemented proper spacing throughout

  - Keyboard navigation for web platform

- [ ] **Advanced data visualization enhancements**
  - Animation transitions for chart updates
  - Interactive data points with tooltips
  - Customizable dashboard layout (drag & drop)
  - Export capabilities (PDF reports, CSV data)

## Technical Architecture

### Key Components
- **useResponsive()** - Dynamic dimension tracking with breakpoint detection
- **QuadrantContainer** - Reusable container with responsive sizing
- **Navigation System** - Adaptive tabs/drawer based on screen size
- **Theme System** - Simple numeric values compatible with existing components

### Responsive Breakpoints
```typescript
breakpoints = {
  phone: 0,      // < 768px
  tablet: 768,   // 768px - 1024px  
  desktop: 1024, // 1024px - 1440px
  large: 1440    // > 1440px
}
```

### Data Structure
All financial data follows the `MonthlyData` interface with detailed breakdowns:
- **Revenue sources:** charging sessions, tax credits, utility kickbacks
- **Cost categories:** utility, maintenance, financing, service provider, insurance

## Development Commands

- `npm start` - Start Expo development server
- `npm run android` - Start on Android emulator/device
- `npm run ios` - Start on iOS simulator/device  
- `npm run web` - Start web development server

## Recent Major Improvements

### Latest Release: Space-Aware Layout System (Current)
**Key Achievements:**
- **Responsive Quadrant Sizing** - Increased dimensions across all breakpoints (350px-500px height, 450px-550px width)
- **Smart Chart Data Windowing** - ROI chart dynamically shows 3-6 months based on available width to prevent label crowding
- **Enhanced Month Labels** - Replaced M1, M2, M3 with proper month names (Jan, Feb, Mar) with abbreviated fallback
- **Chart Cutoff Prevention** - Added margin buffers and padding to prevent chart content from being clipped
- **Improved Typography** - Enhanced font sizes and spacing values for better readability across all screen sizes

**Technical Implementation:**
- Space-aware layout system with QuadrantContainer calculating and passing available dimensions
- Dynamic ROI chart with LineChart replacing BarChart for cumulative revenue/profit tracking
- Responsive data strategy showing relevant time windows based on screen real estate
- Layout structure fixes replacing problematic flex layouts with explicit height-based positioning

### Previous Release: Dynamic Responsive System
**Lessons Learned:**
1. **React Hooks Rules** - Hooks can only be called inside React components, not regular functions
2. **Circular Dependencies** - Avoid complex import chains between modules  
3. **Theme Structure Impact** - Major structural changes require updating ALL dependent components
4. **Debugging Blank Screens** - Systematic analysis: check undefined math, missing imports, hook violations
