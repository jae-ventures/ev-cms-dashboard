# EV Charging Site Dashboard

A responsive React Native dashboard for managing EV charging sites with ROI analysis, cost analytics, charger performance metrics, and action steps.

## Current Status

âœ… **Working State Achieved** - App loads with dynamic responsive system  
âœ… **Navigation** - Switches between tabs (mobile) and drawer (tablet/desktop)  
âœ… **Basic Layout** - Quadrant-based dashboard with working components  

## Development TODO List

### ðŸ”¥ High Priority (Phase 1) - Layout & Responsiveness
- [ ] **Define clear breakpoint behaviors for each screen size**
  - Phone (< 768px): Single column, tab navigation
  - Tablet (768px - 1024px): 2x2 grid, drawer navigation  
  - Desktop (1024px - 1440px): 2x2 grid, drawer navigation
  - Large (> 1440px): 2x2 grid with larger sizing, drawer navigation

- [ ] **Fix tablet layout - replace flexWrap with perfect 2x2 grid**
  - Current: Uses flexWrap which creates uneven rows
  - Target: Perfect 2x2 square grid layout
  - Replace current approach in DashboardScreen

- [ ] **Update DashboardScreen styles for consistent grid spacing**
  - Ensure equal spacing between quadrants in grid mode
  - Maintain responsive behavior across breakpoints

### ðŸ”§ Medium Priority (Phase 2-3) - Grid Implementation & Features  
- [ ] **Implement CSS Grid or precise Flexbox for tablet/desktop layouts**
  - Replace current flexWrap approach
  - Ensure equal quadrant sizes in 2x2 formation
  - Maintain responsive sizing within grid cells

- [ ] **Optimize QuadrantContainer width/height calculations for grid**
  - Update sizing logic for grid-based layouts
  - Consider container queries for better responsiveness

- [ ] **Ensure consistent aspect ratios across all breakpoints**
  - Standardize quadrant proportions
  - Test on various screen sizes and orientations

- [ ] **Review ROI Quadrant financial calculations for accuracy**
  - Verify break-even calculations match business requirements
  - Ensure chart data represents realistic EV charging metrics
  - Test with different data scenarios

### ðŸŽ¨ Low Priority (Phase 4) - Feature Completion & Polish
- [ ] **Complete Cost Analytics Quadrant (currently placeholder)**
  - Implement energy cost tracking
  - Add maintenance cost analytics
  - Include carbon intensity metrics

- [ ] **Complete Action Steps Quadrant (currently placeholder)**
  - Add AI-powered recommendations system
  - Implement actionable task management
  - Create priority-based action items

- [ ] **Complete Charger Performance Quadrant (currently placeholder)**
  - Individual charger monitoring
  - Utilization tracking and analytics
  - Performance trend analysis

- [ ] **Standardize spacing, fonts, colors across all quadrants**
  - Ensure consistent visual hierarchy
  - Align with EV/sustainability theme
  - Test accessibility and contrast ratios

- [ ] **Test responsive behavior on web, iOS, Android platforms**
  - Verify dimension change handling
  - Test orientation changes on mobile
  - Validate navigation transitions between breakpoints

## Technical Architecture

### Key Components
- **useResponsive()** - Dynamic dimension tracking with breakpoint detection
- **QuadrantContainer** - Reusable container with responsive sizing
- **Navigation System** - Adaptive tabs/drawer based on screen size
- **Theme System** - Simple numeric values compatible with existing components

### Responsive Breakpoints
```typescript
breakpoints = {
  phone: 0,      // < 768px
  tablet: 768,   // 768px - 1024px  
  desktop: 1024, // 1024px - 1440px
  large: 1440    // > 1440px
}
```

### Data Structure
All financial data follows the `MonthlyData` interface with detailed breakdowns:
- **Revenue sources:** charging sessions, tax credits, utility kickbacks
- **Cost categories:** utility, maintenance, financing, service provider, insurance

## Development Commands

- `npm start` - Start Expo development server
- `npm run android` - Start on Android emulator/device
- `npm run ios` - Start on iOS simulator/device  
- `npm run web` - Start web development server

## Recent Major Fixes

### Lessons Learned (Latest Commit)
1. **React Hooks Rules** - Hooks can only be called inside React components, not regular functions
2. **Circular Dependencies** - Avoid complex import chains between modules  
3. **Theme Structure Impact** - Major structural changes require updating ALL dependent components
4. **Debugging Blank Screens** - Systematic analysis: check undefined math, missing imports, hook violations

### Technical Implementation
- Created dynamic responsive system with `Dimensions.addEventListener`
- Maintained simple theme structure for compatibility
- Fixed navigation component architecture
- Resolved circular import dependencies
